# RadShare - a money sharing web-app built with AngularJS and Firebase

This is a WIP project of mine for sharing money amongst couples/friends/sharehouses/mates. It isn't trying to be a total financial organiser, merely a simple and useful tool for tracking expenses amongst small groups of people. 

RadShare is built using AngularJS, which is Google's power-play in the JavaScript framework world. There's a lot to learnin Angular, and lots of not immediately apparent syntax, but it is certainly _powerful_.

FireBase is a cloud data storage option that abstracts away the hassles of database access. It does the storage and the syncing via a fairly simple API. It also features an API built exclusively for AngularJS. A powerful coupling.
